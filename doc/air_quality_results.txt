Indoor Air Quality: Some Results

As I've mentioned in other places, the reason I started this project was
due the fact that I was waking up at night, feeling slightly ill, light-
headed, etc.  I noticed this during a period where I was sick, but something
seemed "off".  My wife made the comment that she often wondered about the
quality of the air in our house and that made me start into this project.

What did I find?
