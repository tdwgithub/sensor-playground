Indoor Air Quality: Some Results

As I've mentioned in other places, the reason I started this project was
due the fact that I was waking up at night feeling slightly ill, light-
headed, etc.  I noticed this even more during a period where I was sick; 
something just seemed "off".  During this time, my wife made the comment 
that she had often wondered about the quality of the air in our house.
Given her comment and what I was experiencing, I started into this project.

What did I find?

The first iteration (while still in breadboard form) included CO2 & VOC
sensors.  I had already connected it to Adafruit.IO and done a simple 
dashboard that let me watch the current sensor data, along with some
historical data.  When I woke up at night, I would grab my phone and take
a look.  I did this over several nights, since I was waking up frequently
anyway.  What I found during those nightly looks was that our CO2 levels
inside were nearly 2000ppm.  Since I had been reading about indoor air
quality, I knew that was too high, by a good bit in fact.

Indoor CO2 levels should ideally stay below 1000ppm. While this isn't a
dangerous level, at or above this level, many people start to feel kind
of dozy, sleepy, light-headed, etc. and these effects intensify as the 
levels increase.  In the recent years there has been an effort in 
public schools to monitor CO2 levels and based on the findings, modify
classroom behaviors in order to control the levels.  CO2 levels are 
very often tied to the efficiency of the building's air-handling 
systems (HVAC) and as you would expect, the more people there are in
a room, the more CO2 is being dumped into that room through simple
respiration.  If the air-handling system can't exchange stale indoor
air with fresh air quickly enough, CO2 levels can easily rise above
recommended levels.
