Indoor Air Quality: Some Results

As I've mentioned in other places, the reason I started this project was
due the fact that I was waking up at night feeling slightly ill, light-
headed, etc.  I noticed this even more during a period where I was sick; 
something just seemed "off".  During this time, my wife made the comment 
that she had often wondered about the quality of the air in our house.
Given her comment and what I was experiencing, I started into this project.

What did I find?

The first iteration (while still in breadboard form) included CO2 & VOC
sensors.  I had already connected it to Adafruit.IO and done a simple 
dashboard that let me watch the current sensor data, along with some
historical data.  When I woke up at night, I would grab my phone and take
a look.  I did this over several nights, since I was waking up frequently
anyway.  What I found during those nightly looks was that our CO2 levels
inside were nearly 2000ppm.  Since I had been reading about indoor air
quality, I knew that was too high, by a good bit in fact.

Indoor CO2 levels should ideally stay below 1000ppm. While this isn't a
dangerous level, at or above this level, many people start to feel kind
of dozy, sleepy, light-headed, etc. and these effects intensify as the 
levels increase.  In the recent years there has been an effort in 
public schools to monitor CO2 levels and based on the findings, modify
classroom behaviors in order to control the levels.  CO2 levels are 
very often tied to the efficiency of the building's air-handling 
systems (HVAC) and as you would expect, the more people there are in
a room, the more CO2 is being dumped into that room through simple
respiration.  If the air-handling system can't exchange stale indoor
air with fresh air quickly enough, CO2 levels can easily rise above
recommended levels.  The obvious (but not necessarily easy) thing to do
is to increase the rate of air exchanges in the space you want to control.
In the case of public schools, doing things like opening windows and doors
seems to be the main recommendation.  If the problems are significant, 
work on the HVAC system can be necessary.

See: "AQ_Levels.pdf" in this project folder for some interesting data about
CO2 & CO levels and their effects.

In my home, I first needed to determine what actions I could take that 
would materially impact the CO2 levels.  During one of my middle-of-the-
night "wake and check the air quality" sessions, it occured to me to try
to turn on the blower on our air-conditioner.  Since we have a Nest 
Thermostat and it has the ability to turn the blower on separately from
whether or not it is heating or cooling at the time, I just turned it on 
and started watching the CO2 levels.  The levels when I started were 
around 1800ppm and within about a half hour, they were just below 1000ppm.
As I was trolling around the Nest app, I found that it can schedule the
blower to run for some number of minutes within a time of day range. So,
I started to use that, initially setting time of the blower to be running
at 1/2 hour, each hour of the day.  That was intentionally aggressive
since I wasn't sure what would keep levels where I wanted them. Since
that time, I've been able to work out that running the blower for 
about 15 minutes each hour keeps the worst-case CO2 levels very near
1000ppm.  It peaks just prior the blower staring, then drops below
1000ppm and cycles like that.

Why does my house, with only 2 of us living here, allow CO2 levels to
get so high?  There's no single answer to that question, though there
are a few things to be aware of:

- Most homes are not built with specific facilities for controlling a 
  mix of outdoor & indoor air.  This was especiially true when the
  energy efficiency of houses wasn't considered an issue.  As a result,
  outdoor air coming into the house was the result of mechanical air
  movement inside the house, drawing outdoor air in throught the 
  numerous leaks the home presented.  Being air-tight just wasn't a
  consideration for older homes.  The result of this is that a large
  percentage of air that circulates in older homes (in particular) has
  been recirculated, with a relatively small percentage being sourced
  from outdoors.
  
- Our house was built around 1941-1942, with no notion of fresh-air
  intake in its HVAC design and when we moved in, was quite "leaky".
  We had older windows & doors and the insulation wasn't the best.
  Over time though, we've replaced all the doors, all the windows and
  have added more insulation.  The result is that the house has become
  more sealed.,,reducing its ability to bring fresh air into the space.
  
- We also don't keep houseplants.  It turns out that having plants around
  the house helps to reduce interior CO2.
  
What can you do to improve CO2 levels?

As I mentioned above, I was able to significantly impact the overall CO2 
levels in our home by simply scheduling our HVAC blower to run periodically.
I realize that's not possible for everyone, so here are a few tips I learned
while engaged in this project:

1.  When you can, open some windows or doors.
2.  Get some houseplants that are known to be good CO2 consumers:
    - Bird's Nest Fern
    - Snake Plant
    - Succulents & Cacti
    - Prayer Plants
    - See: https://balconygardenweb.com/most-effective-co2-absorbing-houseplants-proven-by-science/
      for some further suggestions.
3. Turn on your bathroom vent fans.  (It works, trust me.)
4. Add a fresh-air intake to your HVAC system.

What about other indoor air-quality readings?

In a typical home, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) aren't usually too much
of a problem.  That said, individuals do react differently to different sources
of VOC's.  Think of things such as new carpeting.  You know that smell that 
permeates the house when you install new carpeting?  It's the result of VOC's.
New curtains?  VOC's.  Aerosols?  VOC's.  The sensors I've used can provide you
with an aggregate concentation level, but not levels of specific compounds. 
Nevertheless, you can see the effects of these (and other) sources of VOC's and
using that information, you can take steps to reduce them.

Another important air-quality metric for many is particulate-matter.  These 
are pollutants that are suspended in the air and they can cause various 
symptoms in different individuals.  Pollen, dust, smoke, etc. are all
particulate-matter sources.  By tracking the concentrations of these, you can
again work to remove the sources to reduce their presence in your home.  If
you use a PM2.5-type sensor, you should be able to see a correlation between
the outdoor air quality and your indoor conditions.  I regularly check the
US government's airnow.gov site.  If you provide it with your zipcode, it will
produce a display that shows the reported air-quality near your residence.  In
my own case, when airnow.gov reports a lower air quality value, my PM2.5
sensor typically reports an increased concentration.  

Note that one of the ways to improve CO2 that I mentioned can also have a 
negative impact on PM2.5, as opening windows & doors will tend to bring 
more particulate matter into your home.  If you build the Sensor Playground
and have both CO2 & PM2.5 sensors on it, you should be able to see how one
impacts the other. Your mileage may vary.
