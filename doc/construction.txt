Construction notes.

Introducion

The minimum configuration you need for the Sensor Playground includes only:

1. The power-supply section.
2. The processor module section.

Everything else is your choice.  However, this document outlines some of the 
steps you'll need to take to pull off a successful build.


Power Supply

For this section, you will need the following components:

- D1 (1N4007 Diode).
- C1 (33uF Electrolytic Capacitor)
- U2 (LM1117-3.3) Three-terminal regulator
- C2 (33uF Electrolytic Capacitor)
- F1 (LittelFuse LVR100) (Optional)
- R1 (1K-ohm, 14/watt) Resistor.
- LED1 (Standard 5.0mm through-hole) LED
- USB_Power1 (DIYMall Micro-USB Power Adapter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B5ZDLJY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

1. You'll first need to solder the 5-pin header to the micro-USB power adapter.
   This header is included with the package.  Make sure to solder the side of
   the header that has the *shorter* pins into the power adapter board.
   
2. Insert the longer pins of the newly-built micro-USB power supply adapter into
   the Sensor Playground and solder.
   
3. Install D1 and solder.  Note the orientation.  The PCB shows a '+' & '-' symbol on
   either end of the outline.  Make sure to install the end of the diode that has the
   stripe into the '-' side.
   
4. If you want to use a fuse, insert that into the board where "Fuse" has been 
   labeled.  If you decide you don't need the fuse, you can use a piece of solid-core
   wire in its place.  Make sure the gauge is reasonable to avoid high resistance
   and potential heating/melting.
   
5. Insert C1 & C2 and solder.  Note that the footprints on the PCB are marked with
   '+' & '-' symbols.  When inserting the capacitors, make sure you orient them to
   the correct polarity!  Solder.
   
6. Insert the LED and solder.  Again, this is polarity-dependent. Typical through-hole
   LED's have one side that has been flattened.  That side is typically the negative.
   
7. Insert and solder R1 (1K Ohm, 1/4 watt through-hole).
