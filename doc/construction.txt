Construction notes.

Introducion

The minimum configuration you need for the Sensor Playground includes only:

1. The power-supply section.
2. The processor module section.

Everything else is your choice.  However, this document outlines some of the 
steps you'll need to take to pull off a successful build.


Power Supply

For this section, you will need the following components:

- D1 (1N4007 Diode).
- C1 (33uF Electrolytic Capacitor)
- U2 (LM1117-3.3) Three-terminal regulator
- C2 (33uF Electrolytic Capacitor)
- F1 (LittelFuse LVR100) (Optional)
- R1 (10K-ohm, 14/watt) Resistor.
- LED1 (???) Green or Red LED
