Construction Notes, Suggestions, etc.

::: Introduction

As has been mentioned, the design of this project really centers around the idea that you can make it what you want it to be.
There are connection points throughout the PCB that provide:

- Access the the I2C bus of the processor.
- Access to the SPI bus of the processor.
- A UART of the processor.
- 3.3V
- 5.0V

::: It's Designed to be a Platform:

The PCB has been laid out with some already-available sensors in mind (from both Adafruit and Sparkfun), but even with that
orientation, you are not constrained.  For example, you could build a "daughter" or "carrier" board that plugs into one or
multiple available points on the board.  That carrier could then host any sensors, convertors, displays, etc. that you may
desire for your project.

Similarly, you are not required to populate things like the encoder, the two board-mount buttons, or the display (see the
project photos on Hackaday.io for examples).  If you don't need those items for your application, there is nothing in the
design of the circuit or the PCB that requires you populate them.

Note that there are holes in the PCB, again targeted initially at the sensors that I use.  Once again however, these are
available for you to help mount anything you want for your project.

::: Processor

As you know, the circuit and PCB have been designed to allow use of either an ESP32 DevKit-style processor module, or
one of any number of Feather(tm) form-factor modules.  To make this flexibility possible, the Feather form-factor is
laid out to be *inside* the footprint of the ESP32.  If you want to retain the possibility to use either in your own
project, you can choose to populate the sockets for both.  Alternatively, if you only plan to use one of those, then
you can simply avoid populating the other form-factor sockets.

::: Some Surface-Mount Parts...Eek! (relax, it's optional!)

While the vast majority of the PCB has been laid out for through-hold components, I made the decision to add the option
to include one surface-mount component:  A three-pin processor RESET controller.

If your processor module doesn't implement its own RESET control or if it isn't reliable, you can install the 
surface-mount reset controller.  It's surface-mount, but large enough that it shouldn't be too tough to solder down. 
It's located on the top side of the PCB, below the processor module.  I'll provide some notes in another note about some 
techniques for soldering that part onto the board.


::: What if I need IO or support that the board doesn't provide?

One of the reasons I chose the Feather form-factor is that there are quite a number of Feather processor modules that
support expansion, via a related specification: "Feather Wing". This specification outlines how Feather modules can
provide support for expansion modules that are plugged onto the top of them.  You can essentially plug the processor
into the SensorPlayground PCB, then plug FeatherWings onto the processor module.

Wings provide a nice means of expansion but if you decide you need to add one to your application, you will need to
take care to confirm that the FeatherWing you choose won't conflict with other aspects of the existing SensorPlayground
circuit and PCB design.
