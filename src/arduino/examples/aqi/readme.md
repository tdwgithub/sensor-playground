Introduction

This is the sketch that was the basis of the whole project.  It demonstrates how
to use the sensors that I chose and implements a decent IoT-connected indoor 
air-quality monitoring system.  

I've made use of some ugly compile-time switches to allow this to be used on
a number of different processor modules, and I'll describe some of that in 
detail here.  I'll discuss how this all fits together along with some 
suggestions for what you can do next.
