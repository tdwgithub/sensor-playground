Introduction 

The samples here demonstrate various features of the Sensor Playground.  They
aren't written as "final" applications, per se.  You'll note that I've tried
to keep the code fairly straightforward, not doing much of the Computer-Sciency
stuff I'm typically tempted to do.  The idea is to understand how to use the
features of the board, not to offer an off-the-rack application solution.

Arduino Libraries

I didn't provide the various 3rd-party libraries that I use in my sketches.
If I were to do that, I'd probably be violating a ton of copyrights, plus I'd
just end up duplicating the instructions for their use that the authors have
already provided.  

I do provide the source and libraries that *I'm* personally responsible for.
If you're not familiar with how to create your own libraries and how to use them
I'd suggest taking a look here: https://roboticsbackend.com/arduino-create-library/
and at other sources on the InterWebs.  

I've separated the Arduino example sketches from the support libraries I've written.
If you want to use the examples, you'll need to install those libraries into your
copy of the Arduino environment.
